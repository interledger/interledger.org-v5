As Hacktoberfest 2024 wraps up, we’re thrilled to share our open-source community's incredible contributions and community engagement!

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of Open Source that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. This year marked the 11th edition of Hacktoberfest and the third edition of the Interledger Foundation participating in this event.

This year's Hacktoberfest has been a vibrant celebration of collaborative impact. We witnessed new contributions and increased support with new stars on our repositories from seasoned open-source contributors and enthusiastic newcomers. We also partnered with a few open-source and tech communities, that organized local or online events. In this way, we were actively engaging with several open-source enthusiasts.

## Community Events:

Throughout October, the Interledger Foundation hosted and participated in meaningful events that brought together developers, and open-source enthusiasts to share knowledge, collaborate, and learn. Here’s a recap of the key highlights:


- On 11th October, Chimoney x ILF, our colleague Sarah delivered an engaging session on [Open Payments](https://openpayments.dev/), delving into interoperability and financial inclusion. You can follow the [recording of the session here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oju1qiprdhY).
- On 13th October - we partnered with the [Open Source Weekend](https://x.com/OSWeekend) community for their [Open Source Weekend in Gujarat](https://x.com/viralparmarhack/status/1845339255561748673): With over 300 attendees, this event was a major highlight, fostering discussions on open-source innovation and digital financial inclusion.
- On 26th October, while we were in Cape Town for our summit, [CodeWave Hub HacktoberFest 2024 [CodeFest]](https://community.interledger.org/kafiakauser/codewave-hub-x-inteledger-foundation-hacktoberfest24-c2e) took place. This was a great wrap-up event to celebrate open-source contributions and encourage new developers to get involved.
