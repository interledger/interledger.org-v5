## **What is Hacktoberfest?**

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of Open Source that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. This year marks the 11th edition of Hacktoberfest. Every year, thousands of contributors participate in this festival to contribute to the projects they love and use, learn and enhance their skills to advance their careers, and get mentorship and feedback from industry experts. For organizations that believe in giving back to the community, Hacktoberfest is a fantastic platform.

## **Interledger and Open Source 🌐**

The Interledger Foundation aims to enhance access to digital financial services by advocating for adopting an open-source currency network powered by the Interledger Protocol (ILP). Moreover, it actively collaborates with historically marginalized groups to fulfil this mission. These core values inspire us at the [Interledger Foundation to participate in Hacktoberfest](https://interledger.org/hacktoberfest).

This year marks the third edition of the Interledger Foundation participating in Hacktoberfest.
