We are thrilled to kick off our journey with Paysys as they share the story behind "Rafiki Remit" — a pioneering initiative aimed at transforming cross-border remittances in Pakistan. At the heart of this project is Paysys Labs, a leading digital financial services company based in Pakistan.

## **About Paysys Labs**

Founded in 2016, Paysys Labs is a leading provider of digital financial services. Over the years, they have become a trusted partner in the fintech ecosystem by delivering secure, scalable, and innovative financial technology solutions. The work centers on creating seamless digital experiences that enhance customer access to financial products and services. 

## **The Opportunity with Interledger**

The remittance landscape in Pakistan presents a critical challenge. Despite being one of the top remittance-receiving countries globally, the current systems are often slow, costly, and inefficient—especially for the end beneficiaries. Their vision was to tackle this issue by bringing the [Interledger Protocol](/interledger) to Pakistan and building real-world use cases that make cross-border payments as easy as an email.

## **Rafiki Remit: The Project**

Paysys is working closely with Allied Bank Limited — one of the largest and most tech-forward banks in Pakistan as our pilot partner. The project’s aim is to integrate [Rafiki](https://rafiki.dev/), an ILP connector, with ABL’s core banking system using our in-house Open Connect Middleware.

This Proof of Concept (PoC) will enable ABL to operate as a node on the ILP test network, allowing customer accounts to act as digital wallets capable of receiving international payments from ILP-connected institutions.

## **Key Objectives for Paysys**


- Enable Allied Bank Limited to become Pakistan’s first ILP-enabled bank
- Allow ABL consumer accounts to function as ILP payment addresses
- Enhance financial inclusion through low-cost, direct digital transfers
- Lay the groundwork for expanding ILP adoption across more banks in Pakistan.
