## General Info

The Interledger Foundation will host its [annual summit](/summit) in **Mexico City, November 5-6, 2025**. The theme for the summit is _Internet of Opportunity_, while the Hackathon theme focuses on _building the Internet of Opportunity_. Just as the Internet connected people across the globe by enabling networks to interoperate seamlessly, the[ Interledger Protocol (ILP)](/interledger) aims to connect payment networks worldwide.

The vision is simple but powerful:

- The Internet connected people globally.
- Interledger seeks to connect fragmented payment networks by removing barriers and enabling universal access to economic opportunity.

**The ask**: Build solutions that make payments easier, simpler, or more innovative as part of the Internet of Opportunity with Open Payments.

### What is the Hackathon?

The [Interledger Hackathon](/summit/hackathon) is a collaborative event where developers, designers, and innovators come together to experiment with and build on top of Interledger’s open protocols. Participants work in teams to create real-world applications that expand financial access, improve interoperability, and showcase new ideas. The Hackathon is not just about coding, it’s about designing solutions that embody the principle of financial equity for all.

### What is Open Payments?

[Open Payments](/open-payments) is an open standard for sending, receiving, and streaming payments over the Internet. It provides APIs and tools that allow developers to build applications with seamless financial functionality, such as tipping, subscriptions, donations, or micropayments, without being tied to a single payment provider.

By using Open Payments, developers can:

- Integrate payment flows directly into their applications.
- Ensure interoperability across different financial service providers.
- Contribute to building a more open and inclusive financial ecosystem.
