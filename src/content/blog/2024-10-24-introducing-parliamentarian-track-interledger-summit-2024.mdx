This year’s Interledger Summit will host the Parliamentarian Track, bringing parliamentarians from across Africa into the heart of the conversation on digital financial inclusion. Co-curated with the Honorable Neema Lugangira, a Member of Parliament from Tanzania, together with the African Parliamentary Network on Internet Governance (APNIG), this track seeks to deepen multistakeholder dialogue and strengthen collaboration between policymakers and the Interledger community on the development of responsible, interoperable payment systems. These discussions have the potential to shape future legislative agendas and regulatory frameworks that will govern digital finance and inclusion efforts across the continent.

## Why a Parliamentarian Track?

Digital financial inclusion is one of the most important challenges of our time. As digital payments become more integrated into the global economy, the gap between those who have access to these systems and those who do not is widening. Many vulnerable populations, particularly in developing regions, are at risk of being left behind, and the consequences could be adverse for both economic participation and social equity.

Recognizing the pivotal role that governments and policymakers play in addressing this issue, the Interledger Foundation is hosting the Parliamentarian Track to ensure that legislators are at the forefront of this critical conversation. By engaging parliamentarians from diverse African countries, we seek to facilitate the exchange of ideas and solutions for advancing digital financial inclusion. The Parliamentarian Track will provide elected representatives with bespoke programming, allowing them to explore the opportunities and challenges associated with building digital public infrastructure and fostering responsible open payments. It will also offer an ongoing platform for knowledge sharing and capacity building, ensuring that participating parliamentarians leave with a deeper understanding of how they can support the development of inclusive digital financial ecosystems in their own countries.

## Panel Discussion and Messages to National Parliaments

On Saturday, October 26, at 1:30 PM, four parliamentarians will take part in a panel discussion, sharing their insights on the role of policy and regulation in fostering ethical and inclusive digital payment systems. This session will be an opportunity for the Interledger community to hear firsthand from policymakers about how legislation can drive meaningful change in financial inclusion efforts.

In addition, the participating parliamentarians will document their insights and compile a series of recommendations that they will report back to their national parliaments through the African Parliamentary Network on Internet Governance, offering guidance for future policymaking in digital financial services.

## Parliamentarian Perspectives on the Interledger Summit

_Hon. Amira Saber, Member of Parliament, Egypt:_ <br />
“In today’s world where 65 to 70% of the world population own a mobile phone, financial inclusion should be on the agenda of every parliamentarian. It carries a wealth of opportunities for achieving inclusive growth, maintaining financial and social stability, and overcoming many vulnerabilities. As I stand for women empowerment, I consider their digital financial inclusion a personal goal for me. I look forward to learning, sharing, and implementing more on the topic at the Interledger Summit.”

_Hon. Ben Phiri, Member of Parliament, Malawi:_<br />
“We are living in a global village and everything is going digital, digital financing is at the pinnacle of it all. African countries should fast-track digital finance laws and regulations to accommodate such a movement, otherwise Africa shall remain behind.”

_Hon. Esther Passaris, Member of Parliament, Kenya:_<br />
“Empowering marginalized communities starts with prioritizing digital financial inclusion. Digital financial inclusion boosts economic participation and fosters sustainable growth for those previously excluded. It sparks innovation and lowers transaction costs, making it easier for everyone, especially low-income individuals, to thrive in the economy!”

## Engaging with the Parliamentarians

The Interledger Innovation Exhibition on Friday, October 25, will also provide an informal opportunity for community members to meet parliamentarians and exchange ideas. We encourage thoughtful and respectful dialogue during these exchanges. While the Interledger Foundation facilitates the space for these interactions, the nature of the discussions and the direction they take remains in the hands of the individual parliamentarians. The IPU Common Principles for Support to Parliament offer guidelines for ethical and responsible conduct, which reflect the values underpinning our own interactions with elected representatives.
