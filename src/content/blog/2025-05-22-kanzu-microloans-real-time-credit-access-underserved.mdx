We’re excited to introduce the Kanzu Microloans project by Kanzu Finance Limited, developed with support from the Interledger Foundation through the Financial Services Grant. With this project, Kanzu is building an open, instant microloans infrastructure embedded within the flagship platform, Kanzu Banking, and powered by [Rafiki](https://rafiki.dev/) and the [Interledger Protocol](/developers/get-started/) (ILP).

This solution is designed to address the persistent challenges faced by community-based savings groups such as SACCOs, VSLAs, and investment clubs. While these groups play a vital role in grassroots financial inclusion, they continue to face long loan processing times, fragmented systems, and limited access to credit when it’s needed most.

The aim is to provide a mobile-first, interoperable platform where SACCO members can apply for and receive microloans instantly via mobile wallets, with repayment terms tailored to their needs. By leveraging open payments technology, we are eliminating bottlenecks and enabling true financial agility for underserved communities.

Key benefits include:

1. Speed – loans are disbursed in seconds, not days.

2. Security – built on open, secure financial protocols.

3. Inclusion – extends credit to communities traditionally left out of the formal financial system.

4. Interoperability – designed for seamless integration across networks, platforms, and borders.

We’re thrilled to partner with [Kanzu Finance](https://kanzucode.com/) to help them build the future of equitable financial access, starting in Uganda.
