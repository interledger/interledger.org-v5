The Rafiki Remit project aims to transform cross-border payments in Pakistan by enabling seamless connectivity between Allied Bank and the global Interledger Protocol (ILP) network through Paysys Labs middleware solution. This will establish a test node on the ILP network and allow customer accounts to function as digital wallets.

[Rafiki Remit](/node/1365), designed to transform Pakistan's remittance landscape, is the result of [Paysys Labs](https://paysyslabs.com/) pursuit of financial inclusion and advancement in the country. Paysys Labs goal is a reformed, inclusive remittance system that doesn't disproportionately impact vulnerable groups. To achieve this, they are developing Rafiki Remit. A pilot collaboration with Allied Bank, one of Pakistan’s leading and innovation-driven financial institutions, focusing on the use of the Interledger Protocol to explore faster, low-cost, and interoperable remittance solutions.

Piloting a Proof of Concept (PoC) on the ILP Test Network in collaboration with Allied Bank through Paysys Labs’ [Open Connect Middleware](https://paysyslabs.com/products/open-connect/). This would establish Allied Bank's test node on the ILP network, allowing customer accounts to function as digital wallets within the ILP ecosystem. The integration will facilitate faster, more cost-effective remittance services, ultimately expanding financial inclusion in Pakistan.

The Rafiki Remit project is on track, having achieved key milestones in project alignment, communication, and stakeholder engagement. The team have submitted all essential documents to ILF, including project planning and technical specifications, which have clarified customer needs and compliance scope.

The design of Rafiki Remit’s technical architecture ensures seamless integration and communication between Allied Bank's systems and external entities. The system consists of components that would work together to enable fast and compliant transactions. These ensure a secure and efficient remittance experience for senders and receivers.

The process is visualized below (for more technical information on the process, go to the [Progress Report](https://community.interledger.org/arif-paysyslabs/paysys-labs-ilf-grant-progress-report-389p)).

Once Allied Bank gives the go-ahead, the project is ready for the next phase, which focuses on design, development, and testing, during which the team delivers core components, such as integration diagrams and UI/UX prototypes, to ILF. The upcoming development and testing phase will focus on validating key components of the solution, including technical integration, UI/UX, and interoperability testing, as part of the broader pilot effort supported by the Interledger Foundation.

The completion and rollout of Rafiki Remit aims to be another essential step towards building more inclusive and equitable financial systems globally through digital payments.
