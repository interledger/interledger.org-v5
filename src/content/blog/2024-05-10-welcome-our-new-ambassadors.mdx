The Interledger Ambassador Program is for individuals who operate at the intersections of digital finance, open-source, technology, research, policy, creativity, and community.  Each Ambassador is uniquely qualified and willing to utilize their expertise, skills, interests, values, and networks to research new pathways, advance standards, and develop and implement (open-source) technologies. They all share a passion for activating communities that have been – and continue to be – systematically excluded from financial access and empowerment opportunities.

We are delighted to welcome our newest Ambassadors and share the exciting work they will be undertaking throughout 2024:
