## Why This Matters

The digital content economy is evolving rapidly, with projections reaching $69.8 billion by 2030 (Grand View Research). As this landscape grows, content creators, publishers, and users alike are looking for more flexible, intuitive ways to connect and transact.

While ads, subscriptions, and paywalls remain essential tools, the future is about expanding possibilities and empowering choice.

With [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/), we’re adding a new, seamless way for users to support the content they love — complementing existing models with real-time, streaming micropayments. The Web Monetization Extension makes it effortless for users to contribute on their terms, while giving content owners more opportunities to engage their audiences and diversify revenue streams.

It’s all part of building a more open, user-first web where supporting great content is simple, flexible, and accessible for everyone.

## What’s New?

### 1. The Web Monetization Extension (Beta)

Our new browser extension simplifies the process of streaming payments to web monetized sites. With this release, users can:


- **Support their favorite web monetized sites** directly from their web browser in a **quick, non-intrusive, and privacy-preserving way**.
- **Pay only for what they consume**, with real-time micropayments.
- **Support content owners and publishers directly**, fostering a **more sustainable content ecosystem**.

The extension is available on:


- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-monetization/oiabcfomehhigdepbbclppomkhlknpii?utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_campaign=beta_announcement)
- [Firefox Browser Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/web-monetization-extension/?utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_campaign=beta_announcement)
- [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/web-monetization/imjgemgmeoioefpmfefmffbboogighjl)

To start using the extension, users need a Web Monetization-compatible wallet and a quick setup within the extension. Follow our detailed [getting started guide](https://webmonetization.org/supporters/get-started/) for step-by-step instructions.

If you are a content owner and want to benefit from the extension, monetizing your website is easy and can be done in few steps:


- Get a payment pointer or a wallet address.
- Create a Web Monetization link tag using the payment URL 

`&lt;link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice`"&gt;


- Add the to the section of the page.

`&lt;html&gt;`
`   &lt;head&gt;`
`     &lt;title&gt;My Site&lt;/title&gt;`
`     &lt;link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice"&gt;`
`   &lt;/head&gt;`
` &lt;/html&gt;`



This beta release is just the beginning—we’re actively improving the experience based on user feedback.

### 2. Revamped Documentation

We’ve redesigned our documentation to make it clearer and more actionable. Whether you’re a developer integrating Web Monetization, a content owner looking to monetize or a user wanting to support monetized websites, our new docs provide:


- **Step-by-step Guides** to get started quickly
- **Improved Developer Corner** for seamless integration
- **Improved Overviews** for a better understanding of Web Monetization

Check out the new documentation [here](https://webmonetization.org/docs/).

### 3. New Tooling for Content Owners and Publishers

To support adoption, we’ve introduced new publisher tools, a set of easy-to-customize components that content owners can use to tell their website visitors about Web Monetization, starting with:


- **A banner** that informs visitors who don’t have the Web Monetization Extension installed or active and encourages them to support the content they love.
