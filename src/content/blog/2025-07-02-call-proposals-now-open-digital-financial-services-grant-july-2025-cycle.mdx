***$250,000 in grant funding available to advance inclusive digital financial innovation.***

The Interledger Foundation (ILF) invites applications for the second round of its 2025 [Digital Financial Services Grant Program](/financial-services), opening today (July 1) and closing August 1, 2025 at 11:59 pm (EDT). 

This funding opportunity supports the development and integration of financial services, platforms, and products designed to improve access, inclusion, and interoperability in digital finance, particularly for underserved and underrepresented communities. Through this grant, the Interledger Foundation aims to catalyze the growth of an open, interoperable financial ecosystem powered by [Interledger Protocol](/interledger) (ILP) and its suite of technologies, enabling secure, fast, and cost-effective payments across currencies and ledgers.

Applicants may apply under one of the two following tracks:


- **Track 1: Interledger | Enabled (up to $250,000)**

For financial service providers such as digital wallets, mobile money platforms, banks, co-operatives, and neo-banks interested in integrating with Interledger technology, particularly by implementing [Rafiki](https://rafiki.dev/) and establishing themselves as financial nodes on the Interledger Network.


- **Track 2: Interledger | Unlocked (up to $150,000)**

For web-based or online platforms (e.g., e-commerce, digital marketplaces, donation tools) seeking to offer users expanded payment options by integrating [Open Payments](/open-payments) APIs.



## Who Should Apply

This opportunity is open exclusively to registered entities including companies, NGOs, educational institutions, co-operatives, and regulated digital finance providers. We are especially looking for innovative, community-rooted solutions emerging from non-traditional markets or demographics that are often overlooked in global finance.

Projects should demonstrate:


- Clear readiness for integration with Interledger technologies (Rafiki, Open Payments, ILP, etc.)
- A proof-of-concept, demo, or architectural plan showing how the system enables cross-ledger or cross-currency payments
- A defined, active user base or partner community ready to pilot and benefit from the service
- A thoughtful and feasible implementation 12-month timeline, with outlined milestones and sufficient team capacity

## How to Apply

Applications must be submitted via Submittable no later than August 1, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. (EDT).
