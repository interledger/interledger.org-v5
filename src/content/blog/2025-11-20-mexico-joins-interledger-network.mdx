Summarizing everything we experienced in Mexico sounds impossible, and perhaps it is. September was a marathon of hackathons, events, and milestones, in which every city in Mexico reminded us of our purpose.

Our commitment to Mexico begins with Interledger's Student Hackathons, which we hosted at four university campuses, but the scope of the events exceeded all expectations. From Oaxaca to Aguascalientes, passing through the State of Mexico and Mexico City, more than 40 technical and university institutions joined the conversation about open finance, interoperability, and technology with a social purpose. And that was just the beginning.

The dates and host universities were:


- September 11 &amp; 12 - Oaxaca UABJO - Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca.
- September 17 &amp; 18 - State of Mexico UMB - Mexiquense Bicentennial University.
- September 19 &amp; 20 - Aguascalientes UVM - Campus Aguascalientes.
- September 22 &amp; 23 - CDMX ESCOM - National Polytechnic School of Computing.

But our commitment to Mexico went beyond hackathons. During September, the Interledger Foundation also:


- Present at FinnoSummit, the largest fintech event in Latin America.
- Celebrated the premiere of "The People's Code," a documentary that captures the stories behind innovation and financial inclusion.
- Published the study "[Financial Interoperability in Latin America](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MbgINsBUmUe07PvnMzNIqd3zdQCXmjSk/view?usp=sharing)," which analyzes the challenges and opportunities of connecting digital economies in the region.
- And launched the academic paper "[The Missing Link: Remittances and Socially Trustworthy Financial Intermediation as Key Elements to Combat the Root Causes of Migration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13lHsGrRMam4kKw-XOh2ql_pviBwQrBcq/view?usp=sharing)," a key contribution to the debate on the social impact of open finance.

A month of hackathons, ideas, and transformative connections. It all started in Oaxaca; the Interledger team traveled from around the world to support the students. We extend our deep gratitude to the educational institutions that participated in each of the events we held in Mexico in September. Thank you for joining Interledger!

## First Interledger Student Hackathon - Oaxaca

For 24 hours, the [Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca (UABJO)](https://www.uabjo.mx/uabjo-sede-estatal-del-hackathon-estudiantil-interledger-oaxaca-2025) became the epicenter of technological innovation and student talent in southern Mexico. More than 160 students from nine higher education institutions participated in the Interledger Oaxaca 2025 Student Hackathon, an event that marks the beginning of a new era for digital education and open finance in the country.

The hackathon had a clear purpose: to invite undergraduate and graduate students to imagine solutions that improve digital finance through Interledger's Open Payments API, from new forms of monetization to models that facilitate remittances and cross-border payments.

Oaxaca's participation included students from the Central Valleys Institute of Technology, the Technological Institute of the Valley of Oaxaca, the University of the Southern Sierra, the Mesoamerican University, the Technological University of the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, the Technological University of the Mixteca, La Salle Oaxaca University, and the Higher Technological Institute of San Miguel el Grande, along with more than 60 students and 10 teachers from the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Systems and Technological Innovation at UABJO.

During the event, many students brought their diplomas from Platzi's “[Open Payments with Interledger](https://platzi.com/cursos/interledger-openpayments/)” course to be signed by their professor, Marian Villa, DevRel at Interledger. This simple yet powerful gesture reflected their pride in learning and belonging to a global community that promotes open knowledge.

The call for participants in the State of Mexico exceeded all expectations, bringing together students from 11 university campuses in the Bicentennial State Universities Network (UES).

### Thank you, Mexico 🇲🇽!

More than 40 universities and over 500 students took part in this journey through innovation.

From Oaxaca to Mexico City, every conversation, every line of code, and every signed diploma reminded us of something essential:
The future of open payments and interoperability in Latin America is already underway, and Mexico is a fundamental part of that story.

Thank you to all the universities, teachers, mentors, and students who made this event possible, joining the Interledger innovation network and connecting young talent with opportunities in the global digital economy.
