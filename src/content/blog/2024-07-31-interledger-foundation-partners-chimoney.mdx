[Chimoney](https://chimoney.io/) has received a second round of funding from the [ILP Digital Financial Services Grant](https://interledger.org/financial-services)! We are thrilled to be working with Chimoney on this groundbreaking project, which aims to expand global access to digital financial services.

Chimoney is a global payment infrastructure provider specializing in building and providing businesses, startups, and communities around the globe with access to a powerful API and multi-currency wallets.

”We are excited to continue to partner with the Interledger Foundation to make digital financial services more accessible and inclusive. This collaboration unlocks more value for Chimoney and the Interledger Protocol by making Interledger available to tens of thousands of users in Canada, Nigeria, and beyond,” [Uchi Uchibeke](https://uchibeke.com/), Co-Founder and CEO of Chimoney.

The project makes all Chimoney Wallets Interledger-enabled and will include the launch of a new Chimoney App: The Interledger App for Canada with support for Web Monetization and Open Payments. This approach enables efficient, scalable fund transfers between Chimoney Wallets and peer wallets, benefiting our existing and future users and further connecting them with the world.
