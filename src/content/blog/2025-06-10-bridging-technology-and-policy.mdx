## Taking a Fresh Approach to Financial Inclusion

The global conversation around digital financial inclusion has often taken a myopic view that enabling technology was the fastest (and only) route to success. However, as part of his new role as Lead, Public Policy and Government Affairs, Ayden Férdeline aims to help the Interleger Foundation boost its engagement with policymakers and intergovernmental organisations addressing digital identity matters and digital financial services. He believes this collaboration will be crucial in advancing cross border understanding and boosting the implementation of inclusive financial technologies.

Transitioning from his role as an Interledger Ambassador, Férdeline's approach is deeply rooted in recognising that tech innovation alone cannot solve systemic financial exclusion. "Many organisations assume that building better technology will automatically lead to adoption,” he says. “But these are not just technical challenges – they are political problems that require a different engagement strategy."

His new role encompasses three critical domains: legislative and regulatory monitoring, direct policymaker engagement, and strategic grant-making. Each area is designed to create a comprehensive ecosystem that can transform digital financial inclusion.

### Legislative and Regulatory Monitoring

At the core of his approach is the tracking of global, regional, and national policy and regulatory developments. This involves meticulously analysing emerging laws, regulations, and policy development processes across different jurisdictions. Férdeline says that by understanding the evolving regulatory environment, the Interledger Foundation can anticipate challenges for the broader Interledger ecosystem and position its technologies more effectively to adhere in good faith to local laws and regulations.

### Direct Policymaker Engagement

Férdeline's engagement strategy goes beyond traditional technology presentations. His new role will see him and his team create dedicated spaces for dialogue with lawmakers and regulatory bodies, focusing on education and collaborative understanding. The goal is to help political actors comprehend the transformative potential of interoperable payment protocols while still respecting national sovereignty.

"We're not trying to impose a solution, We're creating platforms for meaningful dialogue that help policymakers see how digital financial technologies can support their broader economic development goals," he explains.

### Strategic Grant Creation

The Foundation's grant-making is not techno-deterministic. Rather than simply funding technology development, the Interledger Foundation also issues grants which are strategically designed to support broader ecosystem development.

These include grants to support academic research on financial inclusion and funding university curriculum development. Grants also go towards backing civil society and consumer protection initiatives, as well as grassroots interventions such as educational programs that build digital literacy.

### The Dynamic Coalition

Férdeline will also be building on his achievements as rapporteur for the [Dynamic Coalition](/summit/2024/talk/meet-un-igf-dynamic-coalition-digital-financial-inclusion) on Digital Financial Inclusion - an intersessional working group convened under the auspices of the UN's Internet Governance Forum.

The Dynamic Coalition is preparing to launch a groundbreaking Statement of Principles for advancing digital financial inclusion through interoperable payment protocols when it meets in Lillestrøm, Norway during the 20th annual Internet Governance Forum, which is scheduled for 23–27 June. The principles focus on four critical areas: open and inclusive governance, technical standardisation, regulatory considerations, and consumer-focused ecosystem design.

Férdeline explains that these principles are technology-agnostic and were developed independently by a multi-stakeholder group of subject matter experts including parliamentarians, academics, nonprofit leaders, and business executives. The ultimate goal is to create digital financial inclusion technologies that are adaptable, accountable, and genuinely serve traditionally excluded populations, preventing co-option by dominant financial players.

### Impressive Goals

Férdeline is deliberate about representing the Foundation's goals in international fora. His strategy involves aligning with existing international commitments, creating multi-stakeholder coalitions, developing adaptable implementation frameworks, and focusing on measurement and accountability.

By the end of 2025 he will publish policy briefs and concept notes on topics such as digital identity, the shadow economy, and the intersection of human rights and financial rights.

### Overcoming Prejudices

The path is not without challenges, however, and Férdeline explains that governments remain cautious about external technological solutions. Some also hold deep-rooted prejudices about financially excluded populations including that they do not have money, would not effectively use financial services, and may lack economic agency or potential.

Férdeline's approach is to address these challenges through transparency, flexibility, and a genuine commitment to local contexts. "We're not just developing technology," he says. "We're creating ecosystems of trust, opportunity, and meaningful economic participation."

As digital financial inclusion becomes increasingly critical in a globalised economy, Ayden Férdeline's work represents a sophisticated but holistic approach that recognises technology as just one piece of a complex puzzle.

His vision extends beyond technological innovation to a more profound goal: empowering communities while still respecting national sovereignty, and creating financial systems that are truly inclusive, adaptable, and transformative.
