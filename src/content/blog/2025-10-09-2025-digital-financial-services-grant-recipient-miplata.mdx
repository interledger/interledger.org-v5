As the Interledger Foundation continues to advance equitable financial access worldwide by enabling new solutions that lower costs, improve efficiency, and bridge gaps between existing systems; we are pleased to announce [miPlata](https://www.conplata.com) **(USA)** as the recipient of the March 2025 Digital Financial Services (DFS) grant.

**The Interledger Foundation will support miPlata in developing the first integrated financial platform designed specifically for unbanked Latinos**, connecting employers, workers, and families across borders. miPlata will leverage the[ Interledger Protocol (ILP) ](/interledger)to create a seamless, end-to-end financial solution that unites payroll processing, digital banking, and cross-border remittances. This innovation addresses systemic challenges such as the high costs of financial services, reliance on cash-based remittances, and the administrative burdens tied to paper paychecks.

The Interledger Foundation’s [Digital Financial Services (DFS) grant program](/financial-services) supports projects that use open payment technologies to expand access to affordable, interoperable, and inclusive financial systems. Through this program, the Foundation seeks to empower innovators who are building digital tools that remove barriers to financial participation for underserved populations. In 2025, two DFS grant cycles were launched: the first on March 1, in which miPlata was selected as a grantee, and the second in July 2025, which is currently under review, with new grantees to be announced by the end of Q4 2025.

**We encourage you to subscribe to our **[**newsletter**](/subscribe)** for the latest updates and announcements, and to follow the progress of our grantees through their published **[**#grantreports**](https://community.interledger.org/t/grantreports)**.**

We congratulate miPlata on their selection and look forward to see the impact of their work.
