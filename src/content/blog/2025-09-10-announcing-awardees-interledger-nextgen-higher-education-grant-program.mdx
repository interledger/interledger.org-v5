The Interledger Foundation is excited to announce the inaugural cohort of awardees for its [Interledger Nextgen Higher Education Grant Program](/education), marking an important milestone in our commitment to expanding access, equity, and innovation in digital financial inclusion through higher education partnerships.

This is the first open call under the grant program, following successful pilot collaborations with the University of Cape Town and Bowie State University. These pioneering partnerships were instrumental in shaping the framework for this grant, demonstrating how universities can empower the next generation of students, policymakers, fintech leaders to build an open and inclusive financial future.

The first call, *which is still open and is accepting letters of interest up to Friday, October 3*, attracted inspiring proposals from institutions across the world. To date, we have selected three grantees which represent a diverse set of higher education institutions committed to reimaging financial systems through education and innovation. 


- **The Hague University of Applied Sciences (The Netherlands)** - *Future of Open Payments: Bridging Finance, Technology, and Law for Financial Inclusion*

This semester-long interdisciplinary course introduces law and finance students to the technical and regulatory dimensions of open payment technologies, including the [Interledger Protocol (ILP)](/interledger). By linking financial innovation with regulatory education, the program prepares graduates to tackle challenges like cross-border remittances and microtransactions, building a pipeline of talent for fintech and open payment ecosystems.


- **United States International University of Africa (Kenya)** - *Design Your Future Integrated Innovation Pipeline Program (The Future of Open Payment Technologies for Financial Inclusion &amp; Social Impact)*

USIU-Africa’s DYF IPP program combines design thinking workshops, startup incubation, and leadership training to inspire transformative ideas for financial inclusion in Kenya. By integrating ILP into innovation pipelines and collaborating with MSMEs, students, and institutions, this initiative aims to produce impactful open payment solutions that expand digital financial access across underserved communities.


- **Alabama A&amp;M University (USA)** - *Dollarcraft: Digital Banking Launch Program*

Dollarcraft is a 13-week interdisciplinary challenge where students explore digital banking, entrepreneurship, and ILP-powered financial tools through applied research and a culminating Hackathon. Over two semesters, participants will design, prototype, and showcase inclusive payment solutions, producing 6–8 minimum viable products that connect underserved communities to the digital economy.
