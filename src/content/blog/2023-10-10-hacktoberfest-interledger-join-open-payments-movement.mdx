## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of Open Source that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. This year marks the 10th edition of Hacktoberfest. Every year, thousands of contributors participate in this festival to contribute to the projects they love and use, learn and enhance their skills to advance their careers, get mentorship, and feedback from industry experts. For organizations that believe in giving back to the community, Hacktoberfest is a fantastic platform.

## Interledger and Open Source 🌐

The Interledger Foundation’s (ILF) mission is to broaden the diversity of voices in the tech ecosystem by using the Interledger Protocol (ILP) as a driver for digital financial inclusion. 🌍

The Interledger Protocol is an open-source, currency-agnostic payments network that enables money to travel as quickly and efficiently as data on the internet. The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system.

Interledger's objective is to enhance access to digital financial services by advocating for adopting an open-source currency network powered by the Interledger Protocol (ILP). Moreover, it actively collaborates with historically marginalized groups to fulfill this mission. These core values inspire us at Interledger to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://interledger.org/developers/hacktoberfest/).💪

This year marks the second edition of Interledger participating in Hacktoberfest.🎈
