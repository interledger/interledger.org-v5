## Second Call Opens This July

**The Interledger Foundation is excited to announce the upcoming second Call for Proposals (CFP) for our 2025 Digital Financial Services Grant, launching July 1, 2025, and open through August 1, 2025.**

As part of our ongoing mission to build a more equitable and inclusive global payments ecosystem, this grant round is designed to fund innovative projects that advance financial access and interoperability using Interledger technologies.

This year’s CFP features two distinct funding tracks to support a broad range of digital financial innovations:

**Track 1: Interledger | Enabled** _Funding available: Up to $250,000_

This track is designed for digital financial service providers—including digital wallets, mobile money operators, banks, credit unions, and neo-banks—who are ready to integrate Interledger technology into their core systems.

Participants will work to integrate Rafiki, the Interledger protocol stack, into their platforms, effectively establishing new financial nodes on the Interledger Network. The goal is to unlock seamless, secure, and inclusive cross-network value transfers for users globally.

**Track 2: Interledger | Unlocked** _Funding available: Up to $150,000_

This track targets web-based platforms, such as e-commerce marketplaces, digital content platforms, or donation portals, looking to expand their payment capabilities.

Grants will support projects that integrate Open Payments APIs into existing platforms, giving users more choice and flexibility in how they send and receive payments, with a focus on financial inclusion and open access.

To support prospective applicants, the Interledger Foundation will host a series of Grant **Q &amp; A Sessions** before the CFP launches. These sessions offer a chance to ask questions, get feedback on project ideas, and gain clarity on application requirements. RSVP for a session [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/qa-sessions-interledger-foundations-digital-fi-4386313).
