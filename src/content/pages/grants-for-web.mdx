## Program Overview

The Interledger Foundation’s Grant for the Web program has awarded $400,000 in total to support content publishers and publishing platforms since 2025. Grantees are exploring the viability of a revenue model between ad-supported access and paywalls using Web Monetization.


## Web Monetization

Web Monetization is a technology that allows content creators, publishers, and owners to earn revenue directly from their audiences through small, automatic payments based on real engagement. It is designed as an open web standard and can complement existing monetization models, rather than replacing them. The long-term vision is a web where monetization is built into browsers, empowering content owners to thrive in a fair digital economy by removing barriers between users and the content they love.
