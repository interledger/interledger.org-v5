## How It Works

Interledger breaks payment instructions into packets, routing them through "connectors" that coordinate transfers between different ledgers. This allows value to flow seamlessly across different payment networks.

## Powering the Internet of Opportunity

We believe in financial inclusion, resilience, and equitable access through a connected financial ecosystem. The Interledger Protocol enables seamless exchange of value across payment networks.
