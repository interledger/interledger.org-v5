The Internet connected people. Then it connected devices. Now, it’s connecting financial systems. Interledger’s free, open-source technology is built on the same principles that power the Internet — openness, interoperability, and universality. It allows banks, mobile money systems, fintech platforms, and networks to work together, regardless of their underlying technology or the currency they use.

### This is the funding - this is card 1

### Build with Interledger

### Connect to the network

Interledger open technology is a set of standards and protocols that facilitates payments across different ledgers and payment networks. It works by breaking down payment instructions into small packets, similar to how the internet routes data, and allowing them to travel through a network of "connectors" to reach the recipient. These connectors act as intermediaries, coordinating the transfer and exchange of currency between different ledgers.

Once, where there were blockers and barriers for many, there is now an open-source protocol that liberates financial transactions for everyone.

## Powering the Internet of Opportunity

Interledger adds a missing layer to the internet: the ability to move value as easily as information. The Interledger Foundation stewards this technology to ensure it supports financial inclusion, resilience, and equitable access worldwide.

Together, the Foundation and Interledger open technology are building the Internet of Opportunity — a global ecosystem where financial systems connect freely, value flows without barriers, and new economic opportunities reach people, businesses, and entire communities.
