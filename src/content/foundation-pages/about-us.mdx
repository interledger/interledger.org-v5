The Interledger Foundation (ILF) is a mission-driven nonprofit ensuring that no one is left behind in the digital economy. We support inclusive innovation and financial infrastructure that connects people, communities, and entire economies globally.

## Our role?



We collaborate with entrepreneurs, organizations, and governments to [advocate](/policy-and-advocacy) for equitable access to financial systems and steward the interoperable technologies that power the Internet of Opportunity (IoO). To advance this work we fund [financial services](/financial-services) projects, [education](/education) initiatives, and [ambassador](/ambassadors) programs.

## The Problem We’re Solving



The global financial system is broken, fragmented, and slow.

Billions are excluded from full participation due to:

- High transaction costs and slow settlements  


- Disconnected local and global payment systems  


- Inaccessible remittance infrastructure  


- Limited digital financial tools for creators, freelancers, and the unbanked  

The Interledger Foundation is changing that.

## Our Vision: The Internet of Opportunity



Imagine a world where everyone can send a payment as easily as an email.

With the Internet of Opportunity, powered by Interledger, we make that vision real:

**Open Access**  


Anyone can participate in the digital economy, regardless of location or income.

**Seamless Interoperability**  


Payments move instantly across platforms, currencies, and borders.

**Programmable Transactions**  


New business models become possible, from real-time creator tips to pay-as-you-go utilities.
