## Interledger is the global payments network for inclusive financial service providers.

The Interledger network connects financial services that have implemented the Interledger Protocol (ILP) and helps make payments easier, faster and cheaper.

Traditional payment networks operate independently from each other. Sending money is easy only if the sender and recipient have accounts on the same network, but it can be slow and expensive if they have accounts on different networks.

Interledger makes it easy and inexpensive to send payments in whatever currency or payment network you choose, because Interledger is not tied to any one company, payment network, or currency. Using Interledger, you can send Australian Dollars to someone who wants to receive British Pounds, or you can send United States Dollars to someone who wants to receive Euros.
