[Julaire Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julairefhall/), one of our Program Officers, is at the forefront of our efforts to promote global digital financial inclusion. With a passion that goes beyond just a job, Julaire's work is centred around enabling open, interoperable financial systems that benefit individuals and communities worldwide.

For Julaire, financial inclusion is about providing people with the opportunity to access financial services, regardless of their background. She believes that financial inclusion is a multifaceted endeavour that not only provides access but also empowers people to use and benefit positively from that access.

"Financial inclusion is really about people, irrespective of their socio-demographic profile. We seek to remove barriers that inhibit people's access to financial services and create a world where money can move as easily as information via the internet,“ says Julaire.

Advocating for financial inclusion is not without its challenges. Julaire notes that one of the main hurdles is the lack of infrastructure, whether it be the availability of a physical financial institution or the internet. She also highlights issues of identification, financial literacy, and socio-cultural barriers that restrict certain groups from accessing financial services. However, she is heartened by the innovative solutions and initiatives being developed globally to address these challenges. "Despite these challenges, technology such as the Interledger Protocol can play a critical role in advancing financial inclusion," she says. "With ILP-enabled financial services, money transfers are expected to be affordable and instantaneous, even across borders. We're fostering an ecosystem built on open standards by partnering with local innovators, leveraging ILP to create access points for people currently excluded from traditional financial systems and services."

One project that Julaire is particularly enthusiastic about is the [People's Clearinghouse](https://community.interledger.org/robval/peoples-clearinghouse-progress-grant-report-1-5g9p) initiative in Mexico. This initiative seeks to integrate the [Interledger Protocol](https://interledger.org/developers/get-started/) (ILP) to reduce cash-based transactions in rural communities and enable Mexicans to receive remittances from families in the US.

"I'm excited about the potential of the People's Clearinghouse initiative to make a real difference in people's lives. By integrating the Interledger Protocol, we can reduce cash-based transactions and create easier access to financial services. The project will better equip small community banks and credit unions to provide formal financial services in rural areas where traditional banks do not operate. It will also empower a large segment of the population - women and indigenous communities - to access financial services that position them to save, invest, or borrow to further their economic livelihoods,” she says.

Through her work, Julaire is making a tangible impact on the lives of individuals and communities worldwide. Her passion for financial inclusion and dedication to removing barriers to access are driving positive change. As a Program Officer, Julaire collaborates closely with our program team to design and implement grant programs that support our mission. Two critical initiatives she's leading are the [Digital Financial Services](https://interledger.org/financial-services) grant and the [Next-Gen Higher Education](https://interledger.org/news/interledger-foundation-launches-nextgen-higher-education-grant-shape-future-digital-financial) grant. "The Digital Financial Services grant aims to build equity and inclusion within our network. Through the Next-Gen Higher Education grant, we partner with universities worldwide to expose students to emerging open payment technologies”, she explains.

Julaire's responsibilities include coordinating the grant process, raising awareness about the opportunity among the target audience, and overseeing the review process. She also works closely with selected grantees, providing various platforms for collaboration, support, and oversight of their project implementation. Additionally, Julaire contributes to thought leadership and discourse around digital financial inclusion through our monthly [Digital Money Blog Series](https://interledger.org/news/introducing-2024-digital-money-blog-series).

Julaire serves as a powerful example of the difference that one person can make and we are proud that she has chosen to give her expertise, skill and passion to the Interledger Foundation.
