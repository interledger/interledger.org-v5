In the dynamic landscape of digital transactions, Paystreme is making waves with its groundbreaking streaming payments platform. We're thrilled to announce a pivotal step in our journey: the attainment of our Money Service Business (MSB) license. This milestone propels us into a new era of possibilities, allowing Wallet Guru's Paystreme to deliver real-time streaming payments seamlessly through our financial node on the Interledger Network.

Paystreme is poised to be the pioneer in the realm of payment streaming platforms, offering users the unprecedented ability to make real-time payments for essential services like mobile coverage, broadband internet, pay-TV, streaming content, and more. Envision a world where the need for prepayments and subscriptions fades away, allowing us to revel in subscription-less services.

With Wallet Guru's Paystreme, users can savor the freedom of accessing any service without the encumbrance of prepaid plans or subscription commitments. The introduction of streaming payments heralds a new era, embracing a seamless, pay-as-you-go approach that liberates users from the shackles of inflexible financial obligations. This transformative vision propels us forward, and the MSB license serves as the key unlocking the door to this promising future.

The Interledger Protocol (ILP) is at the heart of our ability to enable real-time streaming payments and revolutionize financial transactions. It transforms the internet from a communications medium into a trusted execution medium, facilitating seamless and affordable transactions of all types, connecting people globally. ILP's open-source nature aligns perfectly with Wallet Guru's mission, promoting inclusion, interoperability, and adaptability in financial services.

One of the key tenets of Wallet Guru's mission is to promote financial inclusion in Latin America and beyond. The ability to provide real-time streaming payments through the Interledger Network takes us a step closer to this goal. In regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited, Paystreme can serve as a lifeline, connecting people to the global economy with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

Imagine a scenario where a low-income individual in a remote area gains access to mobile phone coverage without the need to prepay for services. With Paystreme's pioneering streaming payments, this person can seamlessly obtain mobile phone coverage, pay-as-they-go, and stay connected with the world without financial constraints. This transformative approach not only fosters inclusion but also empowers individuals to access communication, job opportunities, and vital services, marking a significant step toward bridging connectivity gaps.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we are actively developing a Paystreme prototype that will serve as a demonstration of our innovative service and provide us with valuable insights for refinement. We anticipate that this prototype will be ready for showcase by Q2 of 2024. Our recent achievement of obtaining the Money Service Business license is not just a regulatory milestone; it's a testament to our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of real-time streaming payments. We invite you to stay connected as we continue to roll out updates and enhancements that will shape the future of payments.
