[Here to Support](https://www.heretosupport.nl/), in collaboration with [Waag Futurelab](https://waag.org/en/), is the newest recipient of the Digitial Financial Services grant from the Interledger Foundation (ILF). The two organizations will work together to investigate how undocumented residents in the Netherlands currently access financial services and how the utilization of the Interledger Protocol can facilitate their financial access.

This partnership opens new possibilities for addressing the financial exclusion faced by undocumented communities. According to Malou Lintmeijer, Co-Director of Here to Support, "for years, we've focused on the exclusion from banking that different undocumented communities experience. **Working with ILF and Waag Futurelab gives us a unique opportunity to research potential solutions to these challenges thoroughly**. We hope this will lead to the creation of a trust-based banking system in the Netherlands in the future."

This initiative marks a significant step towards understanding and reshaping the financial landscape for those who have been historically marginalized. Briana Marbury, President and CEO of the Interledger Foundation stated, "The partnership between the Interledger Foundation, Here to Support, and Waag Futurelab is crucial in addressing financial exclusion for vulnerable residents of the Netherlands. Together, we will use the interoperable power the Interledger Protocol to work towards an open and inclusive solution for undocumented people."

> _This collaboration not only reflects our core mission, but will also lay the groundwork for other regions to explore creative alternatives to traditional financial infrastructure that can enhance access and inclusion._
