The Interledger Foundation is proud to support Wallet Guru in a second round of [ILP Digital Financial Services](https://interledger.org/financial-services) funding. Wallet Guru is developing the world's first payment streaming platform that enables users to pay for services in real-time.

“Hundreds of millions of unbanked consumers in the developing world must prepay for services like cell phone coverage, broadband internet, pay-TV, and streaming, using costly alternative payment methods. Paradoxically, this results in them paying higher rates than those with postpaid services. Leveraging Interledger, Wallet Guru is developing a platform that provides the fastest and most efficient solution for paying services in Latin America, specifically for prepaid customers. This will enable consumers to stream funds in real-time, ushering in a new era of subscription-less services.” — Fernando Almiñana, Wallet Guru Co-Founder.

With the shared mission to promote and expand digital financial inclusion, Wallet Guru and Interledger Foundation's collaboration will drive innovation and develop open payment opportunities in Latin America and beyond.

“Wallet Guru has demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the technical, regulatory, and market realities of its innovation. It is exciting to witness Interledger-powered projects transition from theoretical to practical. Their commitment to expanding how people consume and pay for essential modern services exemplifies digital financial inclusion and aligns with the Foundation's mission,” Chris Lawrence, Chief Programming Officer.
