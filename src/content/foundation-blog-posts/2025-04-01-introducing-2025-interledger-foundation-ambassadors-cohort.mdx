The Interledger Foundation Ambassador Program is for individuals passionate about activating communities who have been – and continue to be – systematically excluded from financial access and empowerment opportunities.

Each year, we seek individuals who possess distinct qualifications and are eager to explore innovative pathways, enhance standards, and create and implement open-source technologies.

All Ambassadors of the Interledger Foundation are collectively bound by their dedication to promoting digital financial inclusion within their respective communities and areas of expertise. Our previous ambassadors represent a diverse assemblage of individuals passionate about creating positive change. They take pride in their capacity to effectuate change by connecting individuals with events, resources, and one another. To learn more about their impact, you can explore their [grant reports here](https://community.interledger.org/t/ilfambassadorreport).

This year, our foremost objective is to strengthen our commitment to improving interoperability and access to digital financial services, which is crucial for the actualization of rights such as access to education, healthcare, and an adequate standard of living. The exclusion of more than 1.7 billion adults from formal financial systems perpetuates cycles of poverty and marginalization. Rather than perceiving digital financial inclusion as an isolated issue, it should be recognized as a fundamental economic right that enables individuals to engage in financial and economic life actively.

With this in mind, we are thrilled to introduce our newest Ambassadors cohort and highlight the impactful projects they will be leading throughout the year.

Her proposal,”**By Design? The Hidden Harms Within Banking Apps,**” highlights how harmful design patterns (often called dark patterns or deceptive design patterns) are barriers to digital inclusion because they unintentionally trick, confuse, manipulate, or nudge users into making unintended decisions. This project aims to provide those building new digital financial services with insights on how to design inclusively and mitigate the risk of unintentional harm when engaging with demographics or contexts.

We are excited to welcome this new group to the Interledger Community. We look forward to their projects, which will raise our collective awareness and knowledge while simultaneously inspiring enthusiasm for the advancement of digital financial inclusion.
