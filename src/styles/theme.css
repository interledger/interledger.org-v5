/**
 * Dynamic Tailwind Utility Generation
 *
 * CRITICAL: This file MUST import after base/variables.css
 *
 * The @theme inline block generates Tailwind utilities (text-primary,
 * bg-primary, border-primary, etc.) that read from CSS variables at the
 * element's DOM position rather than at :root.
 *
 * This enables pillar theming: when a page wrapper has [data-pillar="mission"],
 * it overrides --color-primary, and all utilities inside that wrapper
 * automatically use the mission color.
 *
 * Without this inline approach, utilities would read from :root only and
 * ignore pillar overrides.
